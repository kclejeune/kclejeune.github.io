# Hi, I'm Kennan.
I'm a 4th year student pursuing B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University.
I started programming on calculators with TI-BASIC back in high school, and I've been hopelessly addicted ever since.
Outside of my studies, I'm avid cyclist, musician, speedcuber, and linux enthusiast.
