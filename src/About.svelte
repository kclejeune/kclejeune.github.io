      Hey, I'm Kennan LeJeune! <br /><br />
      I'm a 4th year student pursuing a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science at Case
      Western Reserve University.â€‹ I started programming on calculators with TI-BASIC
      back in high school, and I've been addicted ever since. Outside of my studies,
      I'm avid cyclist, musician, speedcuber, and linux enthusiast.
      <br /><br />
      I currently do research in the
      <a
        href="https://engineering.case.edu/computer-and-data-sciences/academics/computer-science/bachelor-science"
        >CWRU Department of Computer and Data Sciences</a
      >

      under Dr. Soumya Ray. My work investigates the properties knowledge
      propogation through social networks in multi-agent learning systems, and
      aims to develop dynamic optimization methods to achieve faster training
      convergence for the network as a whole.
      <br /><br />
      After graduation, I'm transitioning to full time work on Software Engineering
      and Data Science at the
      <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/"
        >Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory</a
      >, where I do work on machine learning research for DNA threat
      classification and full stack software engineering with Angular and
      Spring.
